# hello-world
I'm just putting one foot in front of the other at the moment
At least I am not getting frustrated over problems in ==Python Challenge==

I've been a business owner, a professional ballerina, a full time homemaker, volunteer family readiness President and Treasurer at my second husbands military base
I have survived complex PTSD from multiple instances of trauma in childhood, my first marriage, as a stroke survivor, and in my activism
I think I'll be ok learning this
